# SVHN
Street View House Numbers (SVHN) is a real-world dataset containing images of house numbers taken from Google's street view. This repository contains the source code needed to built machine learning algorithms that can "recognize" the numbers on the images.

For this purpose, we will use deep learning and neural network techniques through tensorflow.
